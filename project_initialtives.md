AI-Driven Animation Project Questionnaire


Phase 1: Preparation and Planning

	1.	What is your primary goal for this project?

The project is to start with two major parts of relaxing animal animations for content platforms, YouTube, and gaming products on IOS as major and Windows and Android for marketing purposes; The idea for the two is to make the two parts support each other for getting traffic	 and exposures and in the long term, it can become an IP and perhaps more products related. This is a for-purpose project and a made-for-profit project; however, I HOPE this project can deliver real joy to the audience  or the game player to make my client have a happy time when interacting with my project.
	
	2.	Target audience (select all that apply):

	‚Ä¢	Stress relief and mindfulness users
	‚Ä¢	Children and family viewers

	3.	Estimated project budget range:
This project is my side project and It receives about $1000 per month as the initial budget from my pocket. I am ok to pay the flow up investment but only on its profit. 
This means I do not want to spend too much on the project before the return is generated; hence you can treat the budget as low at the stage;
What I have are 
a couple of computers for Mac and PCs;
A well-established home office with all necessary components.
A pair of  part-time programmer couple with IT degree but they are with very limited experience related to the project; one is data engineer for building ETL pipeline and BI dashboard; one is customer success engineer.
I have paid AI platform subscriptions with all main stream AI platforms;
Relative sufficient time as the couple are WFH as coder.

	4.	Preferred timeline for launch:
the project is my leisure time part time job by nature, also I don‚Äôt think timeline Is a key concern but we can say as soon as possible on the best will.

	5.	Will you collaborate with human artists or agencies for character design?

	‚Ä¢	I am hoping it is an AI-only approach based project as the junior human artists are not really better than ai tools but senior artists are way too expensive as above, the budge is $1000 per month before the return achieves.

	6.	Preferred AI tools or platforms (if any): 

I have literally no idea but willing to pay for the bill on platform subscriptions if it is under the budget. 


Phase 2: Character Design & AI Setup

	7.	Do you have existing character designs or need to create from scratch?
	Need new designs
	8.	How important is consistent character appearance across episodes?
	‚Ä¢	Critical
The project should achieve a couple of very stable and consistent appear	aces for all the main character across episodes; for instance, a main character TIM is a white western high torrents dog with long but hard fur and bear-like face; this appearance should be consistent for all the episodes when TIM is here; how you imagine the Winnie the Poh becomes a yellow donkey! This is the most strict red line, no touch and no space. 

	9.	Preferred method for ensuring consistency:
	‚Ä¢	Fine-tuning AI models with custom data
	‚Ä¢	Prompt engineering and manual review
	10.	Desired animation style (check all that apply):
The video should be ok for whatever style for 3d or 2d but consistent and cute; for gamings, it can be 2d or 3d AND even in different styles when the gaming types change.


Phase 3: Content Production
	11.	Content format preference:

	‚Ä¢	Episodic main story series with	Standalone sitcom-style segments Combination of both; this is to say the main story series should be something like 1001 nights for a super long stories to have the stable audience and story for normal YouTube or anime websites; but the sit-com segments is for the short video platforms. As long video, a constant story line should be ok but for the sit-com, the users may be too busy to understand the whole story but just for a short-win for funs and relief.

	12.	Average video length desired:
the main story should be like peppa pig in international scope or ÂñúÁæäÁæäÂíåÁÅ∞Â§™Áãº in china, and Case Closed in Japan; and should be  about 1‚Äì5 minutes; however, the sitcom, the time should be 10-30 seconds for a super quick win for the short platforms.
	13.	Audio elements needed:
Audio should also be AI-based. The first generation should be English only and gradually, we issue multi language users for the oversea markets.
	14.	Content distribution platforms (select all):
All platform issuing for the video;


Phase 4: Launch and Growth

	15.	Primary monetization strategy:
YouTube ad revenue and In-app purchases (gaming)

	16.	Preferred marketing channels or tactics:
At the first stage, as the tight budge, free activities should be preferred like SEO and content marketing


	17.	Plans for community building (e.g. Discord, forums):
You give me a good head up but I got no idea at the moment; Perhaps discourse forums?

Phase 5: Monetization and Expansion

	18.	Will you explore additional revenue streams beyond initial plans?
In long term or global view, I hope the project can contain multiple universe like doraemon; perhaps the Tim‚Äôs adventure; Tim‚Äôs killing( case closed; Tim‚Äôs ninja; Tim‚Äôs Gongfu; Tim‚Äôs survival for  Zombie for different stories lines and perhaps there are also themes for gamings; also something like super Mario or sonic; gradually, if the project goes well, I can sell the action figures and dolls, or even ip based products like peripherals. And also block chain products perhaps.

	19.	Expansion beyond current project scope (timeframe):
No immediate plans

- **Design:** Create new character designs fully AI-generated.
- **Consistency:** Ensure strict consistency for main characters via fine-tuning AI models and prompt engineering.
- **Style:** Flexible for 2D or 3D; maintain cuteness and consistency.
  
### Phase 3: Content Production

# Recommendations & Next Steps

- **AI Tools Evaluation:** Pilot a range of AI animation generation tools with custom fine-tuning capabilities (Stable Diffusion with LoRA, Bylo AI, Pollo AI).
- **Prototype:** Develop initial character designs and short pilot videos to validate consistency and audience appeal.
- **Content Schedule:** Prepare content calendar balancing story episodes and short clips to optimize viewer engagement.
- **Funding:** Monitor early revenue; consider reinvesting profits into human artist collaborations or advanced tools.
